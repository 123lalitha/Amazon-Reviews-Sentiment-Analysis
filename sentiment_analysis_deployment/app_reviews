2,lalitha y v,bangalore,Cell Phones and Accessories,oppo,"The Camera is overall good but, I was not satisfied with the front camera.
With the combination of One Ui 4.1 and Exynos 900 it turns out to be a good midrange device.",Positive
3,Rajendraprasad A S,kannur,Musical Instruments,oppo,"No earphone slot, very very difficult to take selfie by swapping Palm. Touch is also not of high quality. Lags to Reddme in Quantity, features and at price front

0,bhavya,bangalore,Sports and Outdoors,basket ball,"I have been through several apps trying to find the one and this is it!. It is easy to use,
 easy to add the opposing team and I don't care about their stats, so I just leave in the numbers 
offered and use them to keep score. Everything is big on my Kindle and easy to see. 
I have not used it enough to really compile stats yet,
 so I'm not sure how that will be, but I love everything about how it does individual games.
